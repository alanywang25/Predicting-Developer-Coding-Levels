## Predicting Coding Levels of Stack Overflow Developers

**Project Summary**: Stack Overflow is a website where developers of all levels can ask questions or exchange ideas, and each year Stack Overflow sends out a survey to developers who use the platform. This case study examines data from the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey and uses ordinal regression analysis to determine which survey characteristics collected from developers are associated with their coding levels. 

**Note:** The data for this case study is from the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, and the csv file containing the data in this repository was found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2024/2024-09-03.
